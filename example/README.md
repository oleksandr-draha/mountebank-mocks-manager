Sample use of mountebank-mocks-manager

Here simple setup is prepared:

1. Two applications, Alice and Bob. 
2. Alice receives data from Bob.
3. Alice is connected with Bob via mountebank instance.
4. In the proxy mode Alice sends request to Bob using mountebank, receives response. MMM processes data and creates mocks basing on request/response stored in automatic mode.
5. In mocks mode Alice thinks that she sends request to Bob, meanwhile it sends request and receives response from mountebank.

How to:

1. Build test setup and start services(`docker compose up`). Alice, Bob and mountebank should be running on your machine
2. Setup env for running tests.
3. Run test in proxy mode (`pytest.mark.force_proxy`) should be used for test
4. See imposters dir, new folder with tests should be created. Here new autogenerated mocks will be placed.
5. Remove `pytest.mark.force_proxy` mark and run test in fully mocked mode.
6. Check that it is passing.
7. You can check the process of mocks creating and test passing by stopping at each point like before sending request or before finishing the test and checking mountebank web console (localhots:2525)
